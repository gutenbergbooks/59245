  <h2 class='c006'>NOTES ON THE VARIATION OF ISCHNOCHITON CONSPICUUS CPR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY E. P. CHACE.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the naturalist the study of variation and environment and
their relation to each other is always interesting and to the conchologist
who studies his shells in their natural surroundings
as well as in the cabinet many things are revealed. It is not,
often, however, that variation in form may be so easily traced
to qualities of environment as in the following instance.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Ischnochiton conspicuus</i>, Cpr. is common at San Pedro and is
usually found on the under side of rocks in sandy tidepools.
In this situation they grow quite regularly, showing but slight
variation in form. They are active fellows and evidently sensitive
to light; for if the rocks to which they are clinging are
turned over, they soon glide away, always taking the shortest
route to the under side of the rock.</p>

<p class='c011'>While cleaning a lot of this species taken at San Pedro last
fall two specimens were noticed which differed so widely from
the others that they might easily have been mistaken for another
species. They were much wider and lower-arched than
the typical form and the posterior corners of the valves were
rounded off, making the lateral areas very narrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hoping to find more specimens of this odd form, a trip to
Point Firmen was devoted wholly to the collection of chitons,
with interesting results. The usual species were found in the
tidepools including numerous specimens of <i>Ischnochiton conspicuus</i>
of the ordinary form. Ledges of soft rock beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>tidepools contained many old pholad holes and in these were
found the form for which I was searching. Twenty specimens
of various sizes were collected from as many pholad holes. In
the larger specimens the foot had become so greatly enlarged to
fit the concave bottoms of the holes that it was impossible for
them to curl up in the usual manner. Some of these specimens
were so badly eroded by the sand and gravel which wash in and
out of the holes that the anterior valve was reduced to two
thirds of its normal height.</p>

<p class='c011'>In color pattern, sculpture, and mantle characters these
specimens were identical with those from the tidepools, and, as
will be seen by referring to the table of measurements, the
smaller specimens approach quite closely to the proportions of
the typical or tidepool forms.</p>

<p class='c011'>In brief, Lot 1 shows an angle of divergence constant at 125°
to 130°, where Lot 2 shows an angle varying from 130° to 155°,
and a proportion of length to width 2.51 to 2.80 as against a
proportion ranging from 2.47 to 1.93.</p>

<p class='c011'>The noticeable differences to the eye are first, the narrow and
sharply raised lateral areas, and second, the shape of the posterior
edge of the median valves. In the tidepool specimens
the posterior or exposed edge of each valve is a straight line,
while in specimens from the pholad holes this line becomes a
double convex curve, the most posterior portion of the valves
being about midway between the beaks and the girdle.</p>

<p class='c011'>These differences seem to be explained by the following facts.
In collecting, the tidepool specimens are usually found on the
under side of large rocks and well back from the edge. This
situs protects them from the light which they evidently find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>objectionable, but it makes necessary a nightly journey of about
two feet to the nearest growth of algae on which they feed.
This activity stretches the girdle downward from the edges of
the valves and permits a free play of all the valves so that the
mantle deposits its shelly secretions according to the normal
habit of the species. The specimens living in the pholad holes,
however, apparently never leave them as they are frequently
found feeding on the fucus which overhangs them. It protects
them from the light, so they have no occasion to move about,
and the sand which is washed down into these burrows would
make re-entrance almost impossible. A series of these specimens
shows a gradual change of form. The young specimens
are very similar to young specimens from the tidepools, but as
they increase in size they become crowded so that the valves
press against each other, especially at the posterior end where
the valves are bent back across the bottom of the hole. This
crowding of the valves upon each other and the crowding of the
girdle against the outer edges of the valves so displaces portions
of the mantle as to cause the changes noted above.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several specimens from each situs were disjointed and a study
of the individual valves showed that those from pholad-hole
specimens were thicker and had shorter sutural plates and a
wider sinus, this last being especially noticeable in the valves
from the posterior end. Apparently this change in the sinus is
the result of the broadening of the connecting ligaments due to
compression by the crowding valves.</p>

<p class='c011'>A count of the insertion plates of these disjointed specimens
was made and considerable variation noticed. So much, in
fact, that more specimens were pulled apart for the express
purpose of counting these plates. Representative counts were
as follows: 9 slits on the anterior valve, 2‒3 on the median
valves, and 10 on the posterior. Others show 12, 2‒3, 8; 11,
2‒3; 14, 3‒4, 11. Absolutely no difference in this character
could be found between specimens from the tidepools and those
from the pholad holes.</p>

<p class='c011'>On page 64 of vol. xiv of the Manual of Conchology, Dr.
Pilsbry says, “Carpenter has given a varietal name to a broad,
worn specimen which he thus describes:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>“Var. <i>solidus</i>. Very solid, wide, ashen; inside whitish, the
posterior valve with 10, central valve 2‒3, anterior valve 12
slits. Length 72, breadth 40, divergence 130°. Carpenteria,
near Sta. Barbara, Cal. This is scarcely more than an individual
variation. The mantle (girdle) is normal. The sculpture
is worn away except at the edge. It has evidently lived in a
very exposed situation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From this description and the figure which he gives of the
valves it would seem that this is the same form as my specimens
from the pholad holes. I fully agree with Dr. Pilsbry that it
is hardly worthy of varietal rank. It is, however, too distinct
in appearance to be labeled simply <i>Ischnochiton conspicuus</i>, Cpr.,
and I have therefore marked these specimens from the pholad
holes <i>I. conspicuus</i>, Cpr., <i>form solida</i>, Cpr., using the term <i>form</i>
as advocated by Dr. Cockerell, “to designate variations plainly
due to environment.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class='c006'>LAMPSILIS VENTRICOSA COHONGORONTA IN THE POTOMAC RIVER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY WILLIAM A. MARSHALL.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1912 Dr. A. E. Ortmann recorded<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> finding in the Potomac
River a variety of <i>Lampsilis ventricosa</i><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to which he gave the
name <i>cohongoronta</i>. His records were:</p>

<p class='c019'>September 4, 1909. Potomac River, Hancock, Washington,
Co., Md. (about two dozen).</p>

<p class='c019'>May 9, 1911. South Branch, Potomac River, Southbranch,
Hampshire Co., W. Va. (about a dozen).</p>

<p class='c019'>August 16, 1911. Shenandoah River, Harper’s Ferry, Jefferson
Co., W. Va. (a single male, below medium size).</p>

<p class='c019'>May 6, 1912. South Branch, Potomac River, Romney, Hampshire
Co., W. Va. (about a dozen).</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Ortmann remarked “It is probable that this species will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>turn up elsewhere in the Potomac. The localities known at
present are all to the west of the Blue Ridge Mountain, that is
to say, within the Great Alleghany Valley and the Alleghany
Mountains.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps the above prediction has been realized in a specimen
found at Great Falls, Md., by Mr. Manly D. Barber of Knoxville,
Tennessee, in Sept. 1915. At that time Mr. Barber
brought to the National Museum a basketful of naiades which
he had collected the same day at Great Falls, about 18 miles
above Washington. Among the shells, which were mostly dead
ones, was a specimen of <i>cohongoronta</i>, dead, but in a fine state
of preservation and with the periostracum nearly unblemished
except for the usual erosion at the beaks. Its appearance indicated
that it had been recently alive and that its home had
been in the immediate vicinity of the place in which it was
found. Had it been washed down from Harper’s Ferry, some
50 or more miles above Great Falls it probably would have
shown ill effects from so long a journey.</p>

<p class='c011'>When found the two valves were separated, but so accurately
do they fit together that it is evident they belong to the same
individual. The fact that the valves were separated and yet
were found near each other is additional (though not conclusive)
evidence that they had not been transported any great
distance by currents. At any rate this is the first recorded
finding of the species in the Potomac River so far south as Great
Falls.</p>

<p class='c011'>The specimen is rather a small one. It measures, length 71
mm.; height 47 mm.; diameter 28 mm. It is in the collection
of the U. S. National Museum, catalogue number 273834.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COLLECTING DAYS ABOUT THE NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY JOHN B. HENDERSON.</p>

<p class='c011'>In March last, while waiting for a boat to take us to Haiti,
Dr. Bartsch and I spent nearly three weeks at the U. S. Naval
Station at the entrance to Guantanamo Bay. We employed our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>time in exploring the country about and subjecting it to a high
degree of intensive collecting. In this eastern corner of Cuba
the coastal strip of some ten miles in width is a semi-arid region
with a complex of mountains that are either quite bare of trees
or, at most, covered with a scrub forest and low-growing spiny
shrubs, with, here and there, a wealth of cacti that almost
suggests Lower California. The rock foundation of all this
region,—barring some shore strips of very recently elevated
coral, is everywhere composed of about everything in the line
of rocks except limestone. This is a condition that in the
Antilles usually spells disappointment and failure to the snail
hunter. North of the big bay and then across several miles
of low flat country, just where the foothills of the sierras begin,
lies the city of Guantanamo, interesting to us as the home of
Charles Ramsden, the naturalist. Just north of Guantanamo
is a great rampart of high limestone mountains which beckon
most alluringly to the collector. Sections of this rampart,
somewhat arbitrarily marked off, are the “Monte Verde,” the
“Monte Toro” and the “Monte Libano” of classic fame in
Cuban Natural History.</p>

<p class='c011'>In company with Ramsden we spent a wonderful day on
nearby Monte Libano but a revolution that was then devastating
the province and filling the land with incendiaries and bandits
drove us out of this richer field and obliged us to confine our
attentions thereafter to the arid country lying within the safer
limits of the Naval Station,—some fifty square miles upon which
Uncle Sam holds a long lease.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems to be a natural law that arid or desert lands support
but few species of snails, but that these few species exist in
great numbers and that they take on a very considerable range
of variation. All this is perfectly true of this region. We were
constantly amazed by the great number of specimens to be
found; and each day of exploration in some new valley or over
some range of hills added even greater figures of abundance to
our already astonishing records.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “prevailing” snail of this region is <i>Cepolis ovumreguli</i>
Lea. Its shell is very suggestive of the true helix of Spain or
Algeria of the <i>lactea</i> group. The variation is exceedingly great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in color, size and shape, and it would make a dozen excellent
species if the intermediates were left out of account. Those
living near the coast and among the cacti of the most arid parts
of the district are of whiter and more dull color, are more banded
and show a decided tendency to abnormalities, especially about
the apertures. Specimens from further inland are more polished
and shining, even as though varnished, and are much more
given to a dotted or fly-specked type of ornamentation than to
bands. A fence-post or a dead tree-limb with a hundred specimens
closely assembled in aestivation was no unusual sight.
We learned finally to pay no attention to them. Upon the low
bushes in certain localities the lovely little <i>Cepolis lucipeta</i> Poey
cling like berries. These are the largest and finest of the species
I have ever seen. The range of color variation in this delightful
little snail is also very great, but the colors never blaze out
in the vivid flash of the Polymitas. The blues and purples
and chestnut browns are subdued but very rich and splendid.
One very noticeable color form is the subsp. <i>velasqueziana</i> of
Poey where the many broken bands of the type coalesce into
two broad bluish-black zones of solid color.</p>

<p class='c011'>As nearly all the vegetation of this dry region bears thorns
we did not at first discover that many of these thorns were in
reality Macrocerami. When we did find this out we could
see nothing else. Bartsch and I finally agreed, and shook hands
upon it, that we would gather no more of them, and a stiff
penalty was placed upon any violation of the compact. Two
hundred and more from one bush is an earlier record before we
really got started. This is the <i>Macroceramus festus</i> (Gundl.)
Pfr., blue and yellow and buff in color. Another arboreal snail
of this section is <i>Polymita versicolor</i> Born and it is probably very
abundant in places although we never saw more than fifteen or
twenty on any one tree. This is to me the least attractive
species of that wonderful genus of richly painted snails. The
brilliant yellow and pink are too primitive and the two colors
do not seem to harmonize very well. It always impresses me
as an experimental species that was laid aside in nature’s laboratory
as not wholly a success.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were some ground snails too, but to secure living ones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>required much grubbing up of tufts of tall grass and shaking
out their roots, like digging up miniature potatoes. These are
the <i>Annularia putris</i> (Gundl.) Pfr. and the <i>Chondropoma marginalbum</i>
(Gundl.) Pfr., the latter apparently quite rare. There
are no minute things beyond some few <i>Thysanophora inaguensis</i>
Weinland.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some days we spent gathering marines on the little pebbly
beaches hidden far down under the lofty cliffs that mark this
rugged shore line, and we obtained some unusual species washed
up from the exceedingly narrow island-shelf; blue water is but
a few hundred yards out. Among these are some <i>Conus cedonulli</i>
Lam. Beach collecting is, however, an aggravation; and
too much of it becomes a misdemeanor in the collector’s ethical
code, for it obliges an acceptance of something short of the best.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>AMNICOLIDÆ FROM ONEIDA LAKE, N. Y.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY HENRY A. PILSBRY.</p>

<p class='c011'>The New York College of Forestry, under the direction of
Professor Hugh P. Baker, is carrying on a biological survey of
Oneida Lake and has issued an interesting bulletin<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> upon the
relations of mollusks to fish, by Frank C. Baker. Some <i>Amnicolidæ</i>
obtained during this work, and subsequent to the preparation
of the bulletin were submitted to the writer. The collection
proves to be of considerable interest, including some
species not before noticed.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Amnicola bakeriana</span>, n. sp.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The shell is umbilicate, turrited-conic, thin, whitish-corneous,
somewhat translucent, with unevenly developed striation, distinct,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and close in places, weaker and sparse elsewhere. The
summit is decidedly obtuse, as in <i>A. limosa</i>, the first whorl being
nearly planorboid; subsequent whorls are evenly, strongly convex.
The aperture is very shortly ovate, almost round, its length
contained almost 2½ times in that of the shell. Peristome thin,
in contrast with the preceding whorl for a short distance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 4.3, diam. 2.7 mm.; 5 whorls (type).</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 3.75, diam. 2.3, length of aperture 1.35 mm.; 4⅔
whorls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 4.1, diam. 2.75, length of aperture 1.65 mm.; 4⅔
whorls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oneida Lake; off Short Point in 8½ ft., mud bottom. Lower
South Bay, in 18 ft., on mud bottom.</p>

<p class='c011'>This species resembles <i>A. limosa</i> in the conspicuously obtuse
apex, but differs by the more elevated, turrited spire and the
smaller calibre of the whorls, hence smaller aperture. It is
also a weaker shell, with more whorls in specimens of the same
length.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is also an abundant smaller form, resembling the typical
form in texture, apex and shape of the whorls, varying in
form, but relatively broader than the type. There are some
intermediate examples, but as Mr. Baker considers it desirable
to have a designation for this form, it may be called <i>A. bakeriana</i>
form <i>nimia</i>. The type measures: length 3, diam. 2.5,
length of aperture 1.4 mm.; 4 whorls.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Amnicola clarkei</span>, n. sp.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The shell is narrowly umbilicate, conic, a little obtuse at the
apex, corneous, nearly smooth. The whorls are very convex,
separated by a deep suture, the last whorl tubular. The aperture
is distinctly oblique, almost circular, the upper end rounded,
but a trifle more narrowly so than the base. It projects but
little beyond the preceding whorl laterally. The peristome is
thin, continuous, scarcely or barely in contact with the preceding
whorl above.</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 3.1, diam. 1.9, length aperture 1.1 mm.; 5 whorls
(type).</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 2.8, diam. 1.6, length aperture 0.85 mm.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Operculum having the spiral rather large, the nucleus being
above the lower third.</p>

<p class='c011'>This little species resembles <i>Lyogyrus</i> by its tubular whorls of
small calibre. The whorls are more convex and increase less
rapidly than in <i>Amnicola walkeriana</i>, which is also less slender.
<i>A. schrockingeri</i> Ffld. has less deeply convex whorls, and the
apex is more acute. <i>A. bakeriana</i> is much larger, with a more
obtuse apex.</p>

<p class='c011'>Found in Short Point Bay, Oneida Lake, near shore, in 3 feet
of water, bottom of sand with algae; also in Lower South Bay,
etc. Collected by Mr. F. C. Baker.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is named for Dr. John M. Clarke, the distinguished Director
of the Museum of the State of New York.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c020'><span class='sc'>Amnicola oneida</span>, n. sp.</h3>

<p class='c021'>The shell is typically more slender than <i>A. lustrica</i>, turrited-conic,
narrowly umbilicate, corneous, minutely striate. The
apex is slightly obtuse, but the first whorl projects visibly, as
in <i>lustrica</i>, whorls <i>very convex</i>, parted by a <i>deep suture</i>. The aperture
is ovate, small, its length contained more than 3 times in
that of the shell; upper extremity narrowly rounded. The
peristome is continuous, thin, very briefly in contact with the
preceding whorl above.</p>

<p class='c011'>Length 4, diam. 2, length of aperture 1.25 mm.; 6 whorls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lower South Bay, Oneida Lake, N. Y., collected by F. C.
Baker, 1916.</p>

<p class='c011'>This species is typically narrower than <i>A. lustrica</i> Pils., with
a smaller aperture and shorter whorls; but it is chiefly distinguished
by the more convex whorls (deeper suture), and the
rounded instead of angular posterior end of the aperture. In
<i>Paludestrina nickliniana</i> the last whorl is much longer. Possibly
it may be a subspecies of <i>lustrica</i>, yet it has so distinct an appearance
that a special name seems desirable. There are also
wider examples, which still differ from <i>lustrica</i> by the deeper
suture and aperture.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>NEW GENERA AND SPECIES OF CENTRAL AMERICAN NAIADES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY L. S. FRIERSON.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1893 Messrs Crosse and Fischer divided the Mexican
Naiades into quite a number of sections, to which they assigned
names. Almost simultaneously (in 1900) von Martens and C.
T. Simpson, in treating the Central American Naiades, accepted
some of these sections of Crosse and Fischer, raising them
to generic or subgeneric rank. Because of paucity of material,
considerable diversity of opinion concerning the specific identity
of several species may be noted in the works of these authors.
Furthermore, their work of classification being done independently
and from different points of view, the same species was
sometimes placed by them in different genera.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thanks to the arduous labors of A. A. Hinkley, who has
again and again enriched our cabinets with material and data
from these tropical countries, we are enabled to offer the following
suggestions concerning some of the genera of these shells,
and also the description of an unpublished species.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Nephronaias.</span> This genus has for its type the <i>Unio plicatulus</i>,
Küster, a species identified by von Martens as belonging to
the Lampsiline shells, as <i>aztecorum</i>. Mr. Simpson however
believed it to be nearly allied to the <i>persulcatus</i>, a markedly
Unioid shell. In this the writer follows Mr. Simpson.</p>

<p class='c011'>The genus <i>Nephronaias</i> as constituted by Mr. Simpson embraces
two quite distinct groups, divisible as follows.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Nephronaias</i> (<i>s. s.</i>) embraces <i>plicatulus</i>, <i>persulcatus</i>, <i>melleus</i>,
<i>dysoni</i>, <i>ortmanni</i>, <i>ravistellus</i>, etc. Ample material of these two
latter species show that they are anatomically very closely allied
to <i>Elliptio</i>. There is no sexual difference of shape, and the gill
is gravid in its whole length. <i>Nephronaias</i> differs from <i>Elliptio</i>
in its sulcated disc, in its beak sculpturing, etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Included in <i>Nephronaias</i> by Simpson are, however, shells of a
totally different type, such as <i>medellinus</i>, <i>gundlachi</i>, <i>sapotalensis</i>,
etc. These latter are sexually dimorphic, smoother, more generally
rayed, and the gravid uterus is of Lampsiline type.</p>

<p class='c011'>The position of the dorsal scars within the beak cavities is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>different, in the examples of the pseudo <i>Nephronaias</i> seen by the
writer. <i>Nephronaias</i> (<i>s. s.</i>) possesses an (accessory?) adductor
scar attached to the frontal portion of the cardinal teeth, which
is either absent or obsoletely marked in the second assemblage.
For this latter group the writer, therefore, proposes to use the
generic term of <i>Actinonaias</i> Crosse and Fischer, 1893, type <i>U.
sapotalensis</i> Lea. The female of this species has been described
by Dr. Ortmann (1912). <i>Actinonaias</i> embraces, besides the type,
<i>medellinus</i>, <i>gundlachi</i>, (accepting Simpson’s interpretation of
this latter species), and others.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Psoronaias</span>, Crosse and Fischer (1893). This group of remarkable
shells, embracing <i>crocodilarum</i>, <i>psoricus</i>, <i>semigranosus</i>,
etc., was provisionally treated by Simpson as a group of <i>Elliptio</i>,
but their remarkable sculpturing, and the deep beak cavities of
some of their species, led him to observe that it was possible
that the group should, after all, be placed in <i>Quadrula</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>I follow von Martens, in giving generic rank as above to the

<p class='c021'>Shell small, compressed, rough, brown, biangular. Length
50, height 30, diam. 17 mm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shell hyperbolically rounded before, the extreme frontal
point below the centre. Dorsum slightly arched, descending
behind the ligament to the widely biangular posterior; the
upper angle of which is midway the height, the lower angle
very little above the base, which is nearly straight. The beaks
are small, low, acute, approximate; and <i>apparently</i>, concentrically
ridged. Epidermis dark brown (olivaceous and obsoletely
rayed in the young), rough, the lines of growth numerous and
well impressed. The discs are covered with fine pustulations,
more pustular in front, biradially linear behind. The post
ridge is low, but distinctly double, making the shell biangulate
behind. The teeth are double in the left valve, single in the
right. The cardinals are deeply sulcate and stout. Laterals
slightly curved or nearly straight, separated by an interdentum.
Nacre purple, beak cavities rather deep. Dorsal scars numerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>extending in a row from above the centre of the cavity down
and forward upon the base of the cardinal teeth. Three well
impressed muscle scars in front, two behind, the latter almost
confluent. Habitat, Kux Creek, Chama, Guatemala. Collected
by Mr. A. A. Hinkley, Feb. 6, 1917. A few dead specimens
were obtained on the bank of the Isaibha River (Chama) of
which the Kux Creek is a tributary. Type in Academy Natural
Sciences. Cotypes in collection of A. A. Hinkley, the author
and U. S. N. Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>I place this species in <i>Psoronaias</i> Crosse and Fischer, type <i>U.
psoricus</i>, because of its evident relationship to <i>crocodilarum</i>, and
<i>distinctus</i>, differing mainly from the latter in size and degree
of inflation, being much inferior in both respects to <i>distinctus</i>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>ON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF POND UNIOS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY L. S. FRIERSON.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the latter part of March 1916, the writer, for the purpose
of constructing a fish pond, excavated a barrow-pit near
the bank of a small creek, about ten feet wide, and at the time
nearly dry. The barrow-pit was perhaps one hundred feet long,
fifty feet wide and three feet deep. Early in April, 1916, the
pit became full of water, overflowing from the adjacent creek,
and together with two subsequent overflows, supplemented with
seepage from the newly constructed fish pond, the pit remained
more or less full of water, until May 25, 1917, when it was
drained by a ditch into the nearby creek. From the dried
bottom of this pit some thirty Unios were picked up by the
writer. Ten of these were <i>Unio tetralasmus</i> Say, and the rest
were <i>T. texasensis</i> Lea. All the specimens were of remarkably
uniform size and appearance. The <i>texasensis</i> being about one
and a half inches, and the <i>tetralasmus</i> two and a half inches
long. Exact dimensions of a <i>texasensis</i>: length 43, height 24,
diam. 16 mm.; of <i>tetralasmus</i> 75, 40, and 25 mm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of these species had attained puberty. A female <i>texasensis</i>
had its gills fairly full of young glochidia. A <i>tetralasmus</i>
had several (three or four) ovisacs with a few (remaining)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>glochidia. In assigning an age to these shells it is quite sure
that the <i>tetralasmus</i> discharges its glochidia in March and early
April, so that when picked up on May 25, these shells were just
about fourteen months old, from the date of discharge from their
mother’s gills.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the case of the <i>texasensis</i> (which spawns somewhat later)
it is possible that these were dropped by fish of which, at least
six species obtained access to the pit on May 7, 1916 (on
which date an overflow occurred), thus making about thirteen
months. At any rate the maximum age of either species is
fourteen months from their mother’s ovisacs. One of the <i>U.
tetralasmus</i> is shown of natural size in Pl. VII, fig. 4.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another observation concerning pond mussels might here
prove of interest. A large pond was cut into two by a railroad
embankment, a culvert preserving the level and providing communication
between the two. In the lower and larger pond a
half-bushel of Yonkapin (<i>Nelumbium luteum</i>) seed was sown. It
was six years before these seeds germinated. These plants, during
the summer, cover the entire surface of the pond with their
broad peltate leaves. In this pond the writer planted a colony
of a dozen <i>Anodonta grandis</i>. Several years after, taking advantage
of extreme low water, the writer made a careful survey
of these twin ponds, with the result that hundreds of Anodons
could be found in the upper pond, but not a single one was
found in the lower pond. Either the shade killed the young
shells, or else the glochidia-laden fish avoided the shade of the
lotus plants and congregated in the upper pond (there are no
Nelumbii in the upper pond). Is not this avoidance of shade
a reason for the paucity of unios in the tropics?</p>

<p class='c021'>Among Pupillidae sent by Mr. J. Farquhar there is a new
species from Grahamstown which may be defined by comparison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>with <i>Nesopupa griqualandica</i> (Melv. and Pons.).<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> The new form
is ovate, of about the size of the other species, which it resembles
in sculpture and in the lamellae of the parietal wall and columella.
The two palatal plicae are subequal, the upper emerging
to the lip, the lower one also long, reaching to the inner
edge of the peristome. There is a very small nodule on the
base of the columella. In <i>griqualandica</i> the lower palatal plica
is short and very deeply immersed and there is a distinct though
small basal plica within the base, in front of the lower palatal
plica. In <i>griqualandica</i> there is a deep sulcus outside, over the
upper palatal plica, and a flattening or short groove over the
lower palatal; but in <i>farquhari</i> the sulcus is far less impressed
except quite close to the lip. The color is reddish brown.
Length 1.65, diam. 0.9 mm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Burnup’s figure 9, in Melvill and Ponsonby’s Revision,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a>

the same paper appears to comprise both <i>griqualandica</i> and
<i>farquhari</i>, though chiefly relating to the former. Their pl. I,
figs. 8 and 10 represent <i>griqualandica</i>. The new form is named
in honor of one of the most successful South-African collectors.

<p class='c021'>Shell subovate, being much wider posteriorly, the anterior
margin rather shortly rounded, the right margin nearly rectilinear,
but somewhat diverging anteriorly, the left margin obliquely
expanded and broadly rounded, anterior margin wider and much
more curved than the posterior; apex very excentric, depressed
and decidedly turned toward the right side, bluntly rounded,
smooth except for a few concentric wrinkles; color a very pale
corneous, nearly pure white; lines of growth rather strong and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>irregular; anterior slope with strong radial striæ originating
below the septate growth and extending to the anterior margin,
similar striæ appear on the left lateral slope, but are scarcely,
if at all, visible on the right slope; the septate portion of the
shell is small in comparison with the adult expansion, it is narrow
and the posterior portion covered by the septum is free
from and projects over, but scarcely beyond, the posterior margin
of the adult aperture; the first growth of the shell from the
septate form is continued on the sides in a nearly direct continuation
of the lateral slopes of the septate shell for some
little distance, the anterior slope of this stage is also a continuation
of the anterior slope of the septate stage but owing to the
oblique position assumed by the septate shell is at first somewhat
convex, as viewed laterally, later as the side slopes begin to
expand, the anterior slope is continued in a nearly straight line to
the margin; the left lateral slope of the adult shell below the secondary
constriction is concave at first, becoming nearly straight
toward the margin; the right lateral slope is less concave above
and straighter and more oblique than the left; owing to the
small size of the septum and consequent large aperture of the
septate shell and the narrow first growth of the adult shell there
is no distinct aperture to the septate portion visible in the
adult shell from below, the whole interior of the adult shell
appears to pass, practically unconstricted, directly into the
septate portion; the posterior margin of the adult shell narrow
and somewhat abruptly expanded and reflected.</p>

<p class='c011'>The septate shell is oblong, the sides being nearly parallel,

the left slightly concave; the posterior margin is regularly
rounded; the anterior more broadly rounded; the apex depressed,
bluntly rounded, excentric, reaching nearly to the
right margin, smooth except for slight concentric wrinkles, lines
of growth fine and regular; the anterior slope is slightly convex;
the very short posterior slope below the projecting apex to the

margin so noticeable in other species; aperture much larger than
in any other species yet described.</p>

Guatemala, collected by A. A. Hinkley. Cotypes in the collection
of Mr. Hinkley.</p>

<p class='c011'>This fine species is the first from either Central or South
America, of which both the septate and adult forms are known.</p>

<p class='c011'>It differs from all other described species except <i>crepidulina</i>
Guppy in the small size of the septum and the consequent difference
in the position of the aperture of the septate stage in
the adult shell. The septum in the specimen figured appears
very like the incomplete septum in the North American species,
but as the three adult specimens before me are exactly alike in
the position of the septate shell, this would seem to be the
normal condition in this species. The specimen figured, which
is 3.25 mm. in length, has apparently slightly passed the septate
stage and begun the growth of the constricted portion of
the adult shell and shows the beginnings of the radial striæ.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the Gundlachias was associated a species of <i>Lævapex</i>,
very like the <i>excentricus</i> Morelet. Whether it has any closer
relations with the <i>Gundlachia</i> remains to be determined as the
radula has not yet been examined. While the general aspect
of the two species, if such they be, is very similar, the <i>Lævapex</i>
has a very much more acute apex than the <i>Gundlachia</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>As shown by the figure, the radula of this species is quite
typical of the genus.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>A LIST OF SHELLS FROM THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY BRYANT WALKER.</p>

<p class='c011'>The late Dr. Charles A. Davis, the well known peat-expert
of the U. S. Bureau of Mines, in addition to his special acquirements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>in geology and botany, was a good all-round zoologist
and had a lively and unaffected interest in the work that any
of his friends might be carrying on in that department. It was
his kindly habit in his travels about the country to preserve
any specimens that he came across that seemed to him likely to
be of interest to any of his zoological friends. It will be remembered
that the conchologists owe to him the rediscovery of
the long lost <i>Planorbis multivolvis</i> Case, (<span class='sc'>Naut.</span>, XXI, p. 16),
and also the little <i>Lymnæa davisi</i> Walker, (<span class='sc'>Naut.</span> XXII, p.
17), which bears his name.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the spring of 1911 Dr. Davis’ professional duties took him
to Florida and while there he collected quite a number of
samples of “drift,” which in due time came into my possession.
Several of the localities represented in the collection, such as
Miami and St. Augustine, have already been reported upon by
previous collectors and there seems to be no occasion to duplicate
their work, but quite a number of the places visited by Dr.
Davis have not been covered by any of the previous collectors
in Florida and a record of the species found by him seems
worthy of publication as a contribution to the distribution of
the Mollusca along the east coast of the state.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am indebted to Dr. George H. Clapp for the identification
of the Gastrocoptas and Vertigos.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>COLLECTING IN DIGBY, NOVA SCOTIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY LILLIAN DYER THOMPSON.</p>

<p class='c011'>While traveling through Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
last summer, we stayed for about six weeks at Digby, N. S.
Digby is about 200 miles northeast of Boston, and is situated
near the Bay of Fundy, opposite St. John, N. B. The town
is located on the southeast shore of the Annapolis Basin,—a
sheet of water about twenty miles long and ten miles wide.
This basin is connected with the Bay of Fundy by a channel
about three-fourths of a mile wide at its greatest width. This
channel, known as Digby Gap, is noted for its rapid tides,—the
rate of flow through the Gap being about eight miles an
hour. The tide fall at Digby is thirty feet. The shores of the
Basin are sandy, with the exception of the two rocky promontories
on each side of the Gap; the one which is nearest to Digby
being Point Prim. The town is on a small peninsula on either
side of which are two inlets of the Annapolis Basin, known as
the Racquet, on the west, and the Jacquet, on the east of Digby
proper. On the ebb tide these are almost dry, exposing long
mud flats.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is one island in the Basin, about opposite the Gap and
at the mouth of Bear River, called Bear Island. From this a
long bar extends, called Bear Island Bar, which is covered to a
depth of about six feet at low water, and is covered with eelgrass.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Near the Yacht Club pier were found many <i>Polinices heros</i>,
and their red-brown “sand-collars.” In the Jacquet were
many <i>Litorina littorea</i> and <i>Litorina rudis</i>. On the exposed beach,
nearer the town, we found <i>Mytilus edulis</i>. On the rocks, in the
Racquet, we found <i>Thais lapillus</i> and a host of <i>Acmaea testudinalis</i>
ranging in size from one-eighth of an inch to about an inch
in diameter. In the mud, at the base of the rocks, were a multitude
of <i>Buccinum undatum</i>, <i>Neptunea decemcostata</i>, ranging in
size from one-eighth of an inch to about an inch in diameter.
In the mud, at the base of the rocks, were a multitude of <i>Buccinum
undatum</i>, <i>Neptunea decemcostata</i>, and <i>Colus stimpsoni</i>, all
alive and half-buried. Some dead specimens of <i>Aporrhais occidentalis</i>
were also found, five of them being full-grown.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the suggestion of Capt. Danforth, we constructed a
dredge, and endeavored to dredge Bear Island Bar from his
motor-boat. Here we found quantities of <i>Lacuna vincta</i>, <i>Alectrion
obsoleta</i>, <i>Cylichna alba</i>, and two <i>Polinices triseriata</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were some soldiers encamped at Digby, and they used
to gather <i>Litorina littorea</i> and steam and eat them, without any
flavoring. They sometimes ate <i>Thais lapillus</i> also. One day,
after a rain, we found two <i>Helix hortensis</i> crawling along the
road.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>A NEW TYPE OF THE NAYAD-GENUS FUSCONAIA. GROUP OF F. BARNESIANA LEA.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY A. E. ORTMANN.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the study of the nayad-fauna of the upper Tennessee,
the present writer found that there exists, in this region, a
peculiar type of shells, belonging to the genus <i>Fusconaia</i>, the
various forms of which have been described previously under a
great number of specific names, which, however, seem to belong
all to one species. In addition, among material received from
L. S. Frierson from the Ozark Mountains, a form was discovered
which presented the same structure.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oldest name for the upper Tennessee form is <i>Unio barnesianus</i>
Lea. A more detailed account of its various phases is
to be given elsewhere, and it suffices here to mention only those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>forms which belong here. According to obesity, I distinguish
three local, or ecological races:</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c022'>1. <span class='sc'>Fusconaia barnesiana</span> (Lea) 1838.</h3>

<p class='c021'><i>U. barnesianus</i> Lea, ’38. <i>U. meredithi</i> Lea, ’58. <i>U. pudicus</i>
Lea, ’60. <i>U. Lyoni</i> Lea, ’65. <i>U. tellicoensis</i> Lea, ’72. <i>U.
lenticularis</i> Lea, ’72.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the normal (most abundant) forms we may regard <i>U. meredithi</i>,
<i>pudicus</i> and <i>lenticularis</i>, which differ from each other only
in the development of the rays (topotypes examined). <i>U.
barnesianus</i> is a slightly more elongated individual, with poorly
developed rays. <i>U. tellicoensis</i> (topotypes examined) is a <i>lenticularis</i>
slightly more swollen; and <i>U. Lyoni</i> forms the transition
toward var. <i>tumescens</i>, having a little more elevated beaks, greater
obesity, and rather distinct rays.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c022'>2. <span class='sc'>Fusconaia barnesiana bigbyensis</span> (Lea) 1841.</h3>

<p class='c021'><i>U. bigbyensis</i> Lea, ’41. <i>U. estabrookianus</i> Lea, ’45. <i>U. fassinans</i>
Lea, ’68. <i>Pleurobema fassinans rhomboidea</i> Simpson, ’00.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most frequent form is <i>fassinans rhomboidea</i> (topotypes
examined), with rays poorly developed. <i>U. bigbyensis</i> has
more distinct rays; <i>U. estabrookianus</i> (topotypes examined) is
an old, overgrown form, without rays; <i>U. fassinans</i> is founded
upon an individual (type examined, also topotypes), which is
exceptionally elongated, without rays.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c022'>3. <span class='sc'>Fusconaia barnesiana tumescens</span> (Lea) 1845.</h3>

<p class='c021'><i>U. tumescens</i> Lea, ’45. <i>U. crudus</i> Lea, ’71. <i>U. radiosus</i>
Lea, ’71.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>U. tumescens</i> is the most typical form, greatly swollen, with
more or less developed rays; <i>U. radiosus</i> (type and topotypes
examined) is less swollen, but for the rest like <i>tumescens</i>; <i>U.
crudus</i> (topotypes examined) lacks rays, and has much eroded
beaks, but stands close to <i>radiosus</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The mutual relations of these forms may be understood by
the help of the following key. Only the three largest divisions
are to be regarded as varieties, in the other forms the characters
are merely individual, although specimens representing only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>one (or a few) of these “forms” often prevail at a given
locality.</p>

<p class='c021'>All these shells have the same, and an extremely characteristic
and unique structure of the soft parts, so that there is not
the slightest question that they belong together. I have examined
the soft parts of some 200 specimens in the field, and
over three dozens have been preserved in alcohol, and have
been examined at leisure in the laboratory. They include representatives
of the three main varieties, and of practically all of
the individual variations.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Gravid females</i> have been found on the following dates: May
11, ’13; May 15, ’13; May 16, ’13; May 20, ’13; May 20, ’14;
May 22, ’14; May 25, ’14; July 5, ’13; July 9, ’13; July 10,
’13; July 13, ’13; July 14, ’13. <i>Glochidia</i> have been observed
on May 20, ’14 (immature), and July 14, ’13. Thus this species
evidently is a summer breeder (tachytictic).</p>

<p class='c011'>The soft parts are those of the genus <i>Fusconaia</i>: the <i>supraanal</i>
is separated from the <i>anal</i> by a very short mantle-connection,
which is absent (or torn?) in rare cases. Inner lamina of inner
gills free from abdominal sac. All four gills are marsupial.
Placentae well developed and subcylindrical.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Branchial opening</i> with well developed papillae, <i>anal</i> with
distinct, but small papillae. <i>Palpi</i> subfalciform, posterior margins
connected at base only.</p>

<p class='c011'>While thus the <i>Fusconaia</i> structure is typically developed,
this species is quite unique in its color. This concerns chiefly
the color of the gonads, eggs, and placentae.</p>

<p class='c011'>The soft parts are often uniformly pale, whitish, but may
shade to orange, and the orange is most prominent on foot, adductors,
and mantle-margin; but the paler tints prevail, and
often the orange is replaced by yellowish or brown. The gills
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>are pale, but are generally suffused with blackish. The gonads
are brown to red, mostly of a peculiar dull lavender color in
the female, and the latter color, or purplish brown, is the prevailing
color of the eggs and placentae. The charged gills become
thus rather dark purple, or purple-brown, shading sometimes
to dull red or blackish, in other cases to brownish,
brownish pink, brick-red, or even pale brown. These are very
peculiar tints, by which this species is easily recognized in the
field: four marsupial gills of this blackish-purple color are not
known in any other Nayad.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Glochidia</i> have been found only in specimens belonging to
the headwaters variety (<i>barnesiana bigbyensis</i>). They are subelliptical,
slightly higher than long, L. 0.15, H. 0.16 mm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although a true <i>Fusconaia</i>, this species (or group of forms)
stands isolated within the genus, in characters of the shell as
well as in the soft parts. It differs from the species of the
<i>subrotunda</i>-group (ind. <i>ebena</i>, <i>pilaris</i> etc.) very markedly by its
smaller size and by the very shallow beak cavities. The forms
of the <i>undulata</i>-group (incl. <i>flava</i>, and the <i>cuneolus</i>- and <i>cor</i>forms)
have generally also somewhat deeper beak cavities, and
the shell has a more or less distinct posterior ridge, with a flattening
or a shallow groove in front of it, characters which are
missing in the <i>barnesiana</i>-group. As has been pointed out, in
the latter group, the color of eggs and placentae is remarkable:
in all other forms of <i>Fusconaia</i>, this varies from white to bright
red.</p>

<p class='c011'>I introduce here another species, in order to show that the
<i>barnesiana</i>-type is also represented outside of the Cumberland-Tennessee
drainage, namely in the Ozarks.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c022'><span class='sc'>Fusconaia ozarkensis</span> (Call) 1887.</h3>

<p class='c021'><i>F. ozarkensis</i> Call, Pr. U. S. Mus. 10, ’87, p. 499, pl. 27.

utterbacki</i> Frierson, in: Utterback, Naiad. Missouri
(Amer. Midland Natural 4, 1916, p. 86, pl. 5, pl. 20, f. 63).</p>

<p class='c011'>I have specimens from James River, Galena Stone Co., Mo.,
and White River, Cotter and Norfolk, Baxter Co., Ark., donated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>by L. S. Frierson and collected by A. A. Hinkley on
July 30 and Aug. 2 and 5, ’14, A number of specimens (8)
were preserved in alcohol, coll. July 30 and Aug 2, which all
were gravid females, and one of each date had glochidia. This
marks probably the end of the breeding season, and the species
is tachytictic.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is some confusion with regard to this species. After
the first description by Call, it has not again been recorded, except
by Meek and Clark, and I believe, the identification of
these authors (supported by B. Walker) is correct. But I think
that other authors have seen this form, but have not recognized
it, and, for instance, Simpson’s <i>pannosus</i> and <i>subellipticus</i> (regarded
as varieties of <i>Pleurobema argenteum</i> and <i>breve</i> respectively)
are also this. Frierson’s <i>utterbacki</i> is surely this, since
my specimens were thus labeled by Frierson.</p>

<p class='c011'>Walker, Frierson, and Simpson (in part) believe this to be a
<i>Pleurobema</i>, and not a <i>Lampsilis</i> (see also Simpson, ’00, p. 557,
and ’14, p. 131), and this comes nearest to the truth, in fact,
it is the most plausible assumption to be made from the study
of the shell alone. The shell “resembles a very elongated
<i>Quadrula coccinea</i>,” according to Meek and Clark, and the comparison
with <i>Pleurobema argenteum</i> and <i>breve</i> (which, by the
way, are synonyms), made by Simpson, is significant. We
must keep in mind that Call’s fig. 4 represents the normal shape
of the shell, while his fig. 1 is rather abnormal, and possibly
does not belong here at all. These two figures by no means
represent the female and male, as Call believes.</p>

<p class='c011'>The investigation of the soft parts has shown that this actually
is a <i>Fusconaia</i>. Corresponding, both in soft parts and shell, to
the <i>barnesiana</i>-type of the upper Tennessee region. <i>F. ozarkensis</i>
differs from <i>barnesiana</i> by the more elongated (subtrapezoidal)
outline of the shell, more anterior beaks, and the weak development
of the rays, which are faint at the best, and often entirely
absent. A swollen form of it is not known to me, but
specimens from White River are slightly more convex than
those from James River (farther up). Also Utterback’s quotation of
Frierson (p. 87, footnote) make it probable that there are
differences in obesity.</p>

<p class='c021'><i>Supraanal</i> opening probably separated from the <i>anal</i> by a
short mantle-connection, but in all my specimens this is torn
by rough handling. Inner lamina of inner gills free from abdominal
sac. All four gills marsupial in the female. <i>Placentae</i>
well developed and <i>subcylindrical</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anal opening with small papillae, branchial opening with

connected for about one third of their length or less.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the color of the soft parts, which is so characteristic in
<i>barnesiana</i>, not much can be said, since my material has been
too long in alcohol. But in most of my specimens the gills are
yet distinctly suffused with black. The placentae have been
rendered whitish, but here and there traces of a dark stain are
preserved (which is disappearing gradually). It is quite possible
that the color of the placentae originally was similar to
that of <i>barnesiana</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i>glochidia</i> are subelliptical, slightly higher than long; L.

  <h2 class='c006'>NOTE ON THE RELATION OF SNAIL FAUNA TO FLOODS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>BY A. RICHARDS.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the years 1911 to 1916, while the writer was a member
of the faculty of the University of Texas, a series of incidental
observations on the snail fauna of Waller Creek was
made. These observations have now come to an end due to the
change of residence of the observer. It seems not unwise,
therefore, to publish a short note on the subject in the hope
that the facts recorded, although fragmentary, may have a
bearing on the work of some other follower of snail life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Waller Creek is a small stream near the University of Texas
at Austin. It is some four miles in length and empties into
the Colorado River at a distance of perhaps two miles below the
University. That portion of the stream close to the University
between Fifteenth and Twenty-seventh Streets, was most closely
observed, but data was also collected from the region below.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>During the hot months, from about July 1st to October 1st
usually, the stream is dry, or water is to be found only in an
occasional pool; during the rest of the year the water flows to
a depth of a few inches. The bed is scoured out of limestone
(Austin Chalk) and has for much of its length a solid flat rock
bottom. The banks of the creek have in general a gradual
slope. In time of flood and during heavy rains, this stream
rises very rapidly and quickly becomes bank-full, so that the
water rushes down in a torrent, the roar of which may at times
be heard for a distance of some blocks. The fall of the creek is
considerable, being about 75 feet in two miles from Twenty-seventh
Street to the Colorado, and this fall in connection with
the shape of the bed gives to the current in times of flood a
tremendous force.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the first two years of this observation, 1912‒1913, the
snail population of the creek in its middle stretches was dense.
There were in particular two species very thickly represented,
<i>Planorbis lentus</i> and <i>Physa halei</i>. So numerous were they that
one could in a few moments within a very few feet gather a pint
of either kind. Wherever a little ripple or a tiny waterfall occurred
were many snails oriented in relation to the current, their
heads pointing into it. Elsewhere in the more quiet water they
were also to be found, but in less numbers. These conditions
obtained especially in the early spring; as the breeding season,
which in that latitude extends over half the year, passes by, the
snails of course become much less numerous.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is to be noted that previous to the time when the snails
had become so abundant, there had been no heavy rains of sufficient
importance to be recorded since 1908. Excessive rains
occurred in May 1908, November and May 1907, June and
March 1905, May and April 1904, July and February 1903,
July and November 1902. There was a very severe flood in the
creek in April 1900. It will be seen that between the time
when my observations began and the last excessive rain considerable
time had elapsed and the snails had had the opportunity
to reinstate themselves in the creek, assuming that they
had suffered in those floods as they have done in the later ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fall of 1913 there were two floods of unusual proportions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>in the creek. In October it rose very rapidly, but shortly
subsided, and in November, at the time when the entire state
was visited by the most severe flood since 1869, it was again
subjected to a very thorough scouring. Excessive rains fell on
several consecutive days, and streams in the entire Colorado
watershed were out of their banks.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the heavy rains of the earlier part of the month there
were several days upon which the rainfall, while comparatively
light, was sufficient to keep the creek much higher than its
normal level. When the water finally subsided to its normal
amount the bed was covered completely with a layer of detritus
and soft green humus and algae from a half an inch to an inch
in thickness. This deposit and the acids formed from it have
been the cause of a much more rapid disintegration of the limestone
than had been the case in the immediately preceding
years. Loose pieces of limestone which were exposed to the
action of the water had in many cases fallen apart by the end
of January. Further rises occurred on April 27 and on May
20th, 1914, but were not sufficient to remove all of the accumulated
layer of detritus.</p>

<p class='c011'>In January 1914, a search for snails where they had before
been numerous failed to reveal a single specimen of <i>Planorbis</i>
and less than half a dozen <i>Physa</i>. Even in the deeper pools
they could scarcely be found. Later in the spring in the lowest
part of the stream a number of very small <i>Physa</i>, as well as
some clusters of eggs were found. The force of the current had
been so great as to wash the snails down to the river, and it is
possible that the condition of the water due to the decomposing
humus may have affected those which were able to escape the
flood danger. That some of the Physa were left after the flood
may be attributed to their pointed shape which decreases the
amount of force that the water was able to exert on them as
compared with that on the flat Planorbis shells. Except as
noted above in April and May 1914, the conditions in the creek
remained as normal.</p>

<p class='c011'>In January 1915, Physa has again made its appearance in
the middle parts of the stream, although in small numbers only.
Diligent search, however, failed to reveal a single Planorbis.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>The snails which were present were found only under fair-sized
rocks where they were well protected; they did not occur out in
the open stream as had been the case when the creek was more
densely populated with snails.</p>

<p class='c011'>In April 1915, on the 22d and 24th, Waller Creek was swept
by three scouring floods which devastated the entire bottoms.
The water rose higher during the night than it had at any
time since 1886; bridges were washed away and much damage
done. The bottom of the creek was again washed clean except
under the larger stones and in deep holes in the bed. Snails
were not observed in any numbers following this flood during
the rest of that year. Early in January 1916, however, Physa
had again appeared fairly abundantly where they had formerly
been very thick, in the region just above the University; later
in the spring they became quite numerous here. In January
of this year the first Planorbis were found that had been seen
in the creek since the autumn floods of 1913. Between Fifteenth
and Sixteenth Streets in a pocket containing good-sized stones
over which the water flows rather swiftly a number of specimens
were taken, although none were found above or below
this locality. It is noted that below this region the creek is
frequently covered with oily scum and that it receives the refuse
from the adjoining properties. Except after high water which
would clean it out, the creek in this region would hardly be
expected to support much snail life. It must be supposed either
that the Planorbis had made their way up to Sixteenth Street
during the short time following the floods before the water became
badly contaminated, or else that in this particular place a
few specimens from the previous years had withstood the floods
and reproduced themselves in sufficient numbers to be noticeable
in January. Of these two suppositions the latter seems
much the more rational.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the flood of 1915 the water subsided very quickly so
that a new layer of humus and algae was not deposited, but
that the bed was again restored to its former condition of a clean
smooth rock bottom. Upon the return to this condition the
snail population increased very rapidly, and at the time when
the last observation was made in the early summer of 1916,
seemed in a fair way to return to the condition of 1912.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>It seems to the writer that the slow return of the snails during
the year 1914 was due not only to the repeated rains of the
fall and winter of 1913‒14, but also to the condition of the creek
bed at this time. Although the heavy rains of 1915 were more
severe, they were confined to one month, and the creek bed was
left in a very much cleaner condition than during the preceding
year.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conditions of life which obtain now in Waller Creek are
those of a new life region. This must of necessity be so in an
intermittent stream to a certain extent, but owing to the flood
conditions here they are doubly so.</p>

<p class='c011'>The chief facts of interest in regard to the habits of snails as
shown by these observations, are these: 1, The snails of both
species are to be found commonly in uncontaminated water
which is running at a fairly rapid rate, and the most common
orientation is with the heads pointing up stream; 2, The snail
population in any stream is subject to wide fluctations depending
upon flood conditions; 3, Physa because of its shape is less
affected by floods than Planorbis; 4, The return of the snail
population to a given stream is determined not only by the
frequency and severity of the floods, but also by the condition
of the bottom of the stream after the subsidence of the high
water; 5, The snails thrive best where there is a constantly
renewed supply of clean water which contains little decaying
vegetation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>Dr. William Bullock Clark, professor of geology in the Johns
Hopkins University, eminent for his contributions to geology,
died suddenly from apoplexy on July 27, at his summer home
at North Haven, Maine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wm. Bullock Clark was born at Brattleboro, Vermont, December
15, 1860. Since 1894 he was professor of geology in
Johns Hopkins University. In 1896 Professor Clark organized
the Maryland Geological Society, and has been State Geologist
since that time. The admirable volumes on paleontology of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Maryland, issued under his direction, are widely used by conchologists
interested in fossil mollusks. This series of reports
will be his enduring memorial. Professor Clark’s chief paleontological
interest was in the <i>Echinoidea</i>, upon which he published
several monographs.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>A Monograph of West American Melanellid Mollusks.</span>
By Paul Bartsch (Proc. U. S. Nat. Museum, Vol. 53, pp. 295‒356,
pls. 34‒39, Aug. 1917). This completes the discussion of
the West American mollusks of the super-family Pyramidelloideae,
comprising the family Pyramidellidae, which has
been previously treated, and the Melanellidae here considered.
The former are readily distinguished by having the “nepionic
whorls sinistral and tilted; the axis of the early whorls usually
being at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first
of which the nuclear whorls are frequently quite strongly imbedded.”
In the latter the early whorls are dextral and never
tilted or immersed. A review of the work done in this group
is followed by the descriptions of the species, including forty-nine
new species and one new genus <i>Eulimostraca</i>. The illustrations
are excellent.</p>

(Proc. Linn. Soc. New South Wales, 1916, vol. 41, pt. 4,
pp. 680‒719, pls. 46‒52, issued April 4, 1917). The author’s
notes under <i>Tridacna gigantea</i> Perry are of such general interest
that we quote them in part. “Under the name of <i>Chama gigas</i>
the father of Natural History seems to have embraced the whole
of the modern genus <i>Tridacna</i>. For the name <i>gigas</i>, as restricted
to a single species, the candidates are the shell subsequently
named <i>squamosa</i> by Lamarck and a huge species whose valves
in the Ulrica Museum, together weighed 498 pounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After careful examination, Hanley decided that the furbelowed
clam, such as Reeve has figured for <i>T. squamosa</i>, ought
rightly to bear the name <i>gigas</i>. He based his verdict on the
ground that the actual shell owned by Linné as representing
<i>gigas</i>, is the Lamarckian <i>squamosa</i>, and that to this apply most
of the literary references. Linnean contemporaries such as
Born, Regenfuss and Chemnitz, while making casual references
to the giant, all agree in figuring and describing <i>squamosa</i> as the
Linnean <i>gigas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Discriminating in 1819 between the species his predecessors
had confused, Lamarck unlawfully used the name <i>gigas</i> for the
largest form, while for the Linnean <i>gigas</i> he proposed <i>squamosa</i>.
Attentive to the remarks of Hanley, Hidalgo in 1903, renamed
the biggest species <i>T. lamarcki</i>. But in 1811, Perry had already
used the name <i>Chama gigantea</i> for ‘the largest shell at present
known.’ As the young of the giant has not yet been traced to
the adult, it is still possible that <i>squamosa</i> is a juvenile deeper-water
form of the large intertidal and abraded <i>gigantea</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The heaviest known are a pair weighing 550 lbs., which
Cuvier and Lamarck relate were presented by the Venetian
Republic to Francis I. These still exist, their edges bound
with brass, as holy-water basins in the cathedral of St. Sulpice,
in Paris.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The photographs of Saville Kent show the giant clams in
their natural position on the Great Barrier Reef, where they
occur free and exposed at low tide, standing on their umbones,
and showing their brightly colored mantle and so-called eyes
as they gape.”</p>

to the fact that the same combination was used by O. Boettger
in 1901 for a fossil in his contribution “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zur Kenntnis der

His eminence as a zoologist and unceasing activity as an investigator

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
